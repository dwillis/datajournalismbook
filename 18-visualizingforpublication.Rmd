# Visualizing your data for publication

Doing data visualization well, and at professional level, takes time, skill and practice to perfect. Understanding it and doing it at a complex level is an entire class on it's own. It uses some of the same skills here -- grouping, filtering, calculating -- but then takes that data and turns it into data pictures.

But simple stuff -- and even some slightly complicated stuff -- can be done with tools made for people who aren't data viz pros.

The tool we're going to use is called [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/).

First, let's get some data and work with it. Let's use a cleaned-up version of 2021 PPP loan totals by type of lender. Let's look at it.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
lender_types <- read_csv("data/lender_totals_2021.csv")
```

```{r}
head(lender_types)
```

## Datawrapper

Making charts in Datawrapper is preposterously simple, which is the point. There are dozens of chart types, and dozens of options. To get from a csv to a chart to publication is very, very easy.

First, go to [datawrapper.de](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and sign up for an account. It's free.

Once logged in, you'll click on New Chart.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_datawrapper1.png"))
```

The first thing we'll do is upload our CSV that we created before. Click on XLS/CSV and upload the file.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper2.png"))
```

Next up is to check and see what Datawrappper did with our data when we uploaded it. As you can see from the text on the left, if it's blue, it's a number. If it's green, it's a date. If it's black, it's text. Red means there's a problem. This data is very clean, so it imports cleanly. Click on the "Proceed" button.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_datawrapper3.png"))
```
Now we make a chart. Bar chart comes up by default, which is good, because with totals, that's what we have.

Click on Refine. The first option we want to change is the Number Format, because we have currency figures to display and we want to make it as easy as possible for readers to understand what we're displaying. Datawrapper has an excellent reference for its [custom formats](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/207-custom-number-formats-that-you-can-display-in-datawrapper) that you can consult. Let's choose `$0.[00]a`, which adds a dollar sign and abbreviates larger amounts:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_datawrapper4.png"))
```

Now we need to annotate our charts. Every chart needs a title, a source line and a credit line. Most need chatter (called description here). Click on the "Annotate" tab to get started.

Really think about the title and description: the title is like a headline and the description is provides some additional context. Another way to think about it: the title is the most important lesson from the graphic, and the description could be the next most important lesson or could provide more context to the title.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_datawrapper5.png"))
```

To publish, we click the "Publish & Embed" tab. Some publication systems allow for the embedding of HTML into a post or a story. Some don't. The only way to know is to ask someone at your publication. Every publication system on the planet, though, can publish an image. So there's always a way to export your chart as a PNG file, which you can upload like any photo.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/ppp_datawrapper7.png"))
```
