# Visualizing your data for publication

Doing data visualization well, and at professional level, takes time, skill and practice to perfect. Understanding it and doing it at a complex level is an entire class on it's own. It uses some of the same skills here -- grouping, filtering, calculating -- but then takes that data and turns it into data pictures. 

But simple stuff -- and even some slightly complicated stuff -- can be done with tools made for people who aren't data viz pros. 

The tool we're going to use is called [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/).

First, let's get some data and work with it. [The WHO is publishing corona data as a CSV daily](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). Let's look at it. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
coronavirus <- read_csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/full_data.csv")
```

```{r}
head(coronavirus)
```

Let's make a CSV of data from the United States. We can do that quickly by adding `write_csv` to the end of a filter query.

```{r eval=FALSE}
coronavirus %>% filter(location == "United States") %>% write_csv("uscorona.csv")
```

## Datawrapper

Making charts in Datawrapper is preposterously simple, which is the point. There are dozens of chart types, and dozens of options. To get from a csv to a chart to publication is very, very easy.

First, go to [datawrapper.de](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and sign up for an account. It's free.

Once logged in, you'll click on New Chart.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper1.png"))
```

The first thing we'll do is upload our CSV that we created before. Click on XLS/CSV and upload the file. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper2.png"))
```

Next up is to check and see what Datawrappper did with our data when we upoaded it. As you can see from the text on the left, if it's blue, it's a number. If it's green, it's a date. If it's black, it's text. Red means there's a problem. This data is very clean, so it imports cleanly.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper3.png"))
```

Now we make a chart. Line chart comes up by default, which is good, because with date based data, that's what we have. 

Click on Refine. The first option we want to change is the Tick format. Since we have only so many days of data, change it to months like below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper4.png"))
```

Now we need to annotate our charts. Every chart needs a title, a source line and a credit line. Most need chatter (called description here).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper5.png"))
```

The next thing is we can fix the labels at the ends of the line, to make them readable. Click on them, and a cursor should come  up. Change them from the very data-y total_cases to Total cases along with the rest.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper6.png"))
```

Now we publish. Some publication systems allow for the embedding of HTML into a post or a story. Some don't. The only way to know is to ask someone at your publication. Every publication system on the planet, though, can publish an image. So there's always a way to export your chart as a PNG file, which you can upload like any photo.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/datawrapper7.png"))
```
