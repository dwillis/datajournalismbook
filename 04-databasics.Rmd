# Data, structures and types

Data is everywhere. It surrounds you. Every time you use your phone or buy something online, you are creating data that is stored in cloud-computing centers. Modernity is drowning in data, and more comes along all the time. As journalists, it's critical that we learn to work with it.  

In this class we'll deal largely with two kinds of data: **unaggregated data** and **aggregated data**. 

Consider a spreadsheet of arrests made by police, organized into rows and columns. In its unaggregated form, a single row in this spreadsheet may represent a single arrest, with information like where the arrest took place, the name of the person arrested, and the crime they were charged with. In its aggregated form, the dataset is collapsed so that each row might represent a single category of arrests -- for example, auto thefts -- that includes the number of arrests in that category.    


## Rows and columns

Unaggregated data, oversimplifying it a bit, is organized information that represents something that exists in the real world. In this class, we'll generally make use of unaggregated ["tidy data"](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html#defining-tidy-data) that is organized into a grid of rows and columns. 

Rows -- which run horizontally and are sometimes called observations -- each represent one individual element in a group.  Columns -- which run vertically and are also sometimes called variables or fields --  represent features of that group. If each row is a single arrest, the first column might explain the charge, the second the date and time, the third the location. And so on. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/data1.png"))
```

One of the critical components of data analysis, especially for beginners, is having a mental picture of your data. What does each row represent? What does each column in each row signify? How many rows do you have? How many columns? 
All semester, we'll work with a dataset of loans made under the Paycheck Protection Act, a government program that loaned money to businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic with the goal of keeping people employed.  In the raw, unaggregated data set we'll work with, each row represents a single loan made to a single company. Each column describes a different feature of that loan: the company's name, the company's location, the industry the company operates in, the lender name, the amount of the loan, and so on.    

## Types

There are scores of data types in the world, and R has them. In this class, we're primarily going to be dealing with data frames, and each element of our data frames will have a data type.

Typically, they'll be one of four types of data:

* Numeric: a number, like the number of car accidents in a year or the number of journalism majors.
* Character: Text, like a name, a county, a state.
* Date: Fully formed dates -- 2019-01-01 -- have a special date type. Elements of a date, like a year (ex. 2019) are not technically dates, so they'll appear as numeric data types. 
* Logical: Rare(ish), but every now and then we'll have a data type that's Yes or No, True or False, etc.

Is a zip code a number? Is a jersey number a number? 

Trick question, because the answer is no. When we think of data types, numbers are things we do math on. If the thing you want is not something you're going to do math on -- can you add two phone numbers together? -- then make it a character type. If you don't, most every software system on the planet will drop leading zeros. For example, every zip code in Boston starts with 0. If you record that as a number, your zip code will become a four digit number, which isn't a zip code anymore. 

When we load data into R, the library we'll use will try to guess the correct data type for each column.  Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes it gets it wrong.  As we'll see, we change data types during and after loading.
